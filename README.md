# soloProject1

This project is still currently in progress

My project idea is a basketball pickup game website. My target audience is young adults that enjoy playing basketball. Itâ€™s purpose is  tracking the amount people in surrounding basketball courts.
The website provides users all the information needed for them to decide which courts to go to based how many people they feel most comfortable playing with. Users also have a platform where they can interact with each other make posts and feeds with anyone within their picked friend group.
