# soloProject1

This project is still currently in progress

My project idea is a basketball pickup game website. My target audience would be young adults that play basketball.  It would be used to track how many people are at all courts near you.
So if the user wants to go to a court where there are fewer people so they can shoot around they can do or if they want to play with other people they also have that info based on the info given on the app. The users also have a platform where they can interact with each other make post and feeds with anyone within they picked friend group.
